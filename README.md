## Plans

* Load Perl file that we can edit.
* Click on a menu item to tidy and replace the current buffer with the new version using some fixed tidy configuration.
* Create a second text window, this time read only and show the result there
* Add a checkbox and some other entry widget for some of the options.
* Use some external diff program to show the differences
* Use some perl-based diff tool to show the differences
* Include all the configuration options.
* Allow saving the configuration options
* Open file with configuration options
